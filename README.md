Enhanced targeted DNA methylation with dCas9-DNMT3A3L of the CMV and endogenous promoters entails distinct subsequent histone modification changes in CHO cells


## Analysis workflow
With this project, we analyze targeted bisulfite sequencing data of the CMV and the FUT8 promoter for the study entitled "Enhanced targeted DNA methylation of the CMV and endogenous promoters with dCas9-DNMT3A3L entails distinct subsequent histone modification changes in CHO cells" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2021.04.014). 
Percentages of methylation values at individual CpG positions within the bisulfite DNA amplicon are represented as Pie charts.
